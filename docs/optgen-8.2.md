  * Improve the infeasibility check to verify decision variable bounds (such as minimum generation greater the installed capacity)
 
* IHM
  * Fixed an error related to final date of of min/max capacity constraints
  * Fixed an error related to saving generic constraints

## Fixed Bugs

* OptGen 1
  * Automatically disables the Efficient Frontier calculation option in cases with a fixed plan to avoid errors
  * Fixed error messages that indicated "warning" but resulted in a fatal errors in the model

* OptGen 2

## Fixed Bugs

* OptGen 1
  * Fixed the consideration of NID projects' capacity with integer investment variables in user-defined expansion plans
  * Fixed an error that caused the elimination of decisions of integer projects present in the user-defined expansion plan
